## ðŸ”­ Who am I in a few words...

â€¢ I'm an IT Consultant with more than 15 years of business consulting experience in the Technology Information's Industry (IBM Maximo, IBM 
Tririga, SAP HCM, HR Access). Recently converted into a fullstack web developer ( Junior at the moment ).

â€¢ I've been involved in the delivery of more than 25 client projects within several sectors: Public Sector, Oil & Gas, Telecommunications, 
Banking, Retail, Human Resources, Aviation, Distribution, Manufacturing and Transportation. 

â€¢ I have an extensive experience in process reengineering and complete cycles for the implementation of computer solutions (analysis, design, development, testing and go live).

â€¢ I've been assigned to projects in different geographies and languages (USA, Canada, Latin America, and Europe).

## ðŸŒ± Latest news about me...

Over time, IT solutions became more complex tools that required to be managed by more specific profiles, whether functional or technical.
Thus, my professional experience led me to play a mostly functional role throughout the projects in which I was participating. However, I was always drawn to being able to participate in technical tasks. 

So I started to refresh my programming skills through the study of the Fullstack web developer bootcamp. This repository is the result of several months of continuous effort and dedication.

## ðŸ’¬ I've been trained in...

â€¢	Frontend Web Development:  HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/JSX, React/Redux, Jest/Enzyme.

â€¢	Backend development: API Rest, Node.js, MySQL, Mongo, Firebase

## ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration

I would love to collaborate with a company where I can demonstrate my programming skills and help create useful applications.
