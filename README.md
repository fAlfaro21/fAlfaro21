â€¢ I've been assigned to projects in different geographies, with international teams, and on site/hybrid/remote basis.

## ðŸŒ± Latest news about me...

Over time, IT solutions became more complex tools that required to be managed by more specific profiles, whether functional or technical.
Thus, my professional experience led me to play a mostly functional role throughout the projects in which I was participating. However, I was always drawn to being able to participate in technical tasks. 

So I started to refresh my programming skills through the study of the Fullstack web developer bootcamp. This repository is the result of several months of continuous effort and dedication.

## ðŸ’¬ I've been trained in...

â€¢	Frontend Web Development:  HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/JSX, React/Redux, Jest/Enzyme.

â€¢	Backend development: API Rest, Node.js, MySQL, Mongo, Firebase.

â€¢   Data Bases: MySQL, Mongo y Firebase.

â€¢   Deployment: Netlify, Heroku, AmazonWS.

â€¢   Development tools: Bash, VSCode, GitHub.

I would love to collaborate with a company where I can demonstrate my programming skills and help create useful applications.
